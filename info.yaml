  title:        "Moving Average Filter"
  language:     "Verilog"
  description:  "10-bit moving average filter designed to smooth input data streams."

  how_it_works: |
      The design implements a moving average filter using a series of registers and a finite state machine (FSM). 
      The filter calculates the average of a set of recent values in a data stream, determined by the FILTER_POWER parameter. 
      This smooths out short-term fluctuations and highlights longer-term trends or cycles.

      The master module handles input and output processing, including bidirectional IO handling and filter selection based on input control signals.

  how_to_test:  |
      To test the moving average filter, provide a series of digital input values to the 'ui_in' port and observe the smoothed output on 'uo_out'. 
      The 'uio_in' can be used to control the filter's width and operational parameters. 
      Test with varying input patterns and filter widths to evaluate the filter's response.

  inputs:               
    - "ui_in: Primary 8-bit digital input for the moving average filter."
    - "filter_select: Control bits to select filter width (part of uio_in)."
    - "strobe_i: Strobe input for synchronization (part of uio_in)."

  outputs:
    - "uo_out: 8-bit output presenting the moving average result."
    - "strobe_out: Strobe output indicating data validity."

  bidirectional:
    - "uio_in: 8-bit bidirectional port for additional controls and data."
    - "uio_out: 8-bit bidirectional port for status and auxiliary outputs."
